# baton-runner

Orchestrates a multi-phase build. You (the session running this skill) are the
**baton-runner-manager**: a thin, restartable scheduler. You never write product
code, run tests, or read diffs/baton contents — you spawn **units** (subagents),
thread file *paths* between them, commit, open a draft PR per phase, enforce
budgets, log, and pause. All state lives on disk (`baton-runner/<run-id>/`) so a
fresh manager session resumes from `STATE.md` indistinguishably.

> Run in an **Opus** session. Correctness over speed. Detail lives in
> [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md); this file is the control flow.

## Golden rules

1. **Opus only** — every spawn uses `model: opus`.
2. **Manager stays lean** — read only each unit's 3-line return; move *paths*,
   never contents; never open diffs/batons/gate-logs. Write `STATE.md` at each
   phase boundary; when your own window fills, finalize STATE, tell the user to
   resume fresh, and stop.
3. **Manager does all git/remote; units never do.**
4. **Verification is delegated** — "done" = the unit's `STATUS` + the review
   unit's `VERDICT`, never your own inspection.
5. **Context crosses agents only through files** (batons, phase-exit digest).
6. **Stop, don't guess** — user-input, budget ceiling, or fatal error → PAUSE
   (write STATE, show the user, stop).

## Roles

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **work-unit** | Implements a phase's acceptance criteria via `tdd`, capturing RED test output as evidence. |
| **review-unit** | Independent of the implementer. Runs `scripts/gate.sh`, then `code-review` + `security-review` + intent check; emits `VERDICT`; on `CLEAN` writes the phase-exit digest. |
| **fix-unit** | Implements the review-unit's findings via `tdd`. |
| **baton / digest** | `baton-pass` file carrying unit state (updated incrementally) / terse map of public surface + decisions threaded to later phases. |

## Pre-flight — before work unit 1

- [ ] **Fresh single worktree**; confirm `baton-pass`, `tdd`, `code-review`,
      `security-review`, and `scripts/gate.sh` resolve there.
- [ ] **Parse + right-size** the phase list (each phase ≤ ~5 acceptance criteria
      / ~10 files; split larger into ordered sub-units).
- [ ] **Spec readiness** per phase → `READY` / `THIN` / `BLOCKED` (draft proposed
      criteria for `THIN`).
- [ ] **Unit agent (project default `python-pro`)** — this project runs **all**
      units (work, review, fix) as `python-pro`, which carries the `Skill` tool
      and so can invoke the `tdd`/`baton-pass`/`code-review`/`security-review`
      skills the contracts require. The user may still override per phase; any
      alternative must support file edits + Bash + the `Skill` tool (see REFERENCE
      → "Unit agent"). Record per phase in STATE.
- [ ] **Open questions + signoff** — surface ambiguities, the proposed criteria,
      and the chosen agent. **Do not spawn work unit 1 until the user signs off.**
- [ ] **Init** `baton-runner/<run-id>/` (`STATE.md` + `log.md` with tunable
      budgets). TodoWrite: one todo per phase.

## Per-phase loop

For each phase in order, with **fresh context** (this phase's spec + the
accumulated phase-exit digests only):

1. **WORK** — spawn a work-unit (`subagent_type` = the phase's unit-agent,
   `python-pro` by default). On
   return: `INCOMPLETE` → continuation from its baton until `COMPLETE`;
   `NEEDS_USER`/`FATAL` → PAUSE.
2. **Commit** (manager; transient red is fine — healed before the PR).
3. **REVIEW loop (max 3):** review-unit runs the gate then reviews → `VERDICT`.
   `CLEAN` → digest written, break. Else fix-unit → commit → loop. Not `CLEAN`
   after 3 → PAUSE with a failure baton; offer **guide-resume / waive / abandon**.
4. **Draft PR** stacked on the previous phase.
5. **Progress line**, update `STATE.md`, advance.

When all phases are `CLEAN` + PR'd: set `STATE = DONE` and summarize (draft PRs,
stacked-merge order, any waivers).

## Spawning, budgets, pause

- **Spawn:** `model: opus` always; **all units (work, review, fix) use the
  phase's unit-agent, `python-pro` by default.** Build
  prompts from the REFERENCE templates — always include the spec/baton path, the
  worktree path, the return + containment contracts, and the bail budget
  (≈50 tool-calls / ≈10 files). Record the returned baton path in STATE first.
- **Budgets:** a progress line after every unit; **global ceiling 75 units**
  (pause → reauthorize); **per-phase thrash alarm 20**. Tunable in STATE.
- **Containment:** units write only inside the worktree, never mutate git/remote,
  and must declare (not silently add) dependencies. Out-of-bounds → PAUSE.
  (Full contract in REFERENCE.)
- **Pause/resume:** on any pause, write `STATE = PAUSED` with the exact resume
  point and stop; re-invoking the skill reads `STATE.md` and continues. Never
  restart completed phases.
